# WasteLess

## Inspiration
Restaurants, schools, hospitals, and hotels generate approximately 22-33 billion pounds of food waste each year. Although there is a greater focus on food waste within the United States, restaurants still continue to throw 94% of their excess food. That's why we created WasteLess!


## What it does
Instead of tossing leftover food that won't be served the next day, why not donate the surplus to local food banks? Our goal is to connect restaurants, schools, hotels, and more with food banks to prevent daily leftovers from being wasted. Tailoring to the user's needs based on their profile, an institution will have the ability to post information about their food surplus, while individuals will be able connect to a place with leftover food. When an individual selects a location, they can easily view the address of the food bank along with any supplementary information to make the redistribution process run smoothly. In doing so, we hope to support local food banks by directing excess food traffic towards them. From the business side, we developed an application for organizations that hope to reduce their waste, minimize their carting costs, or simply receive tax incentives. We believe that rescuing restaurant, school, and hotel cuisine should be simple and  seamless, which is exactly what WasteLess aims to do. Join us in supporting food banks and reducing food waste.

## How we built it
WasteLess was developed utilizing Google's open source framework Flutter along with HTML, Objective-C, Ruby, Swift, and Kotlin. After the user verifies their credentials in our login page, the home page provides information on how to post or locate an insitution with excess food. We used the Google Maps API to display pinpoints of restaurants, hotels, and schools nearby the user based on their location and a pinpoint based on their specified search. Within the business side, we utilized Google Cloud's Firebase Realtime Database to store each of the restaurants, hotels, and schools' informational posts.
